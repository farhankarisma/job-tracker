# Gawekeun | Job Tracker

Welcome to my very first fullstack project, Gawekeun!, it's a website for tracking our jobs vacancies using system like kanban board. This project is build using Nextjs, React, GSAP, Redix for the frontend tech stack, and Express, Postgre, Supabase, Prisma for backend tech stack.

# Background Application

Seventh semester arrives like a storm —
the campus calls for internships as the next step in our journey.
Job vacancies scatter like leaves in the wind —
some caught, some lost, and many still drifting in the unknown.

For those still waiting, time becomes tangled.
Between studying, working, family moments, and silent hopes,
it’s easy to lose track — to forget which doors have been knocked on,
which are still unopened.

Gawekeun is born from this chaos —
a gentle compass in the whirlwind.
With a simple drag-and-drop,
it helps you trace your steps, organize your path,
and bring clarity to the noise.

Dedicated to my colleagues who are in the same problem to gain their dream internship/job!
